Our FastMIM simply reduces the input resolution and replaces the pixel target with HOG target. These modifications are simple yet effective. FastMIM (i) pre-train faster; (ii) has a lighter memory consumption; (iii) can serve as a generic framework for all kinds of architectures; and (iv) achieves comparable and even better performances compared to previous methods. More details can be found at [FastMIM](https://github.com/huawei-noah/Efficient-Computing/tree/master/Self-supervised/FastMIM).

We design local multi-scale reconstruction, where the lower and upper layers reconstruct fine-scale and coarse-scale supervision signals respectively. This design not only accelerates the representation learning process by explicitly guiding multiple layers, but also facilitates multi-scale semantical understanding to the input.
